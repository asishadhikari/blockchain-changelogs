each compoenet of the path (formed by nested dirs) is dentry
directories are also just files to a VFS
file info is stored as inode at a different location 

objects of FS:
	<> Superblock represents file system 
	<> inode represents specific file metadata
	<> dentry represents directory entry - a single component of the path could be regular file or directory but a directory is also just a file
	<> file represents an open file and is associated with a process
