   There is no set way to choose a theme. 
   Even Elon Musk does not know why he chose the set of problems he chose to solve
   I can always start on a problem, keep working on it and keep working on new ones as I haad
   

   The challenges  	:
   	<> managing time even musk does not know how to do it
   	<> making sure that you have a corrrecter feedback loop

   	Bottom line.. There are no right answers it is only your character that matters

   	you are always wrong and it is your goal to be less wrong
   	Have to ask for feedback from friends ask them that you really want to know
